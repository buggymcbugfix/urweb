# The formatter against the real compiler: for each file given, the
# compiler's parse of the file and of its formatted form must be the same
# program (`urweb -stop parse` prints the desugared AST, positions
# excluded, so two files that print the same are the same program), every
# comment must survive, and formatting the result again must change
# nothing.  One line per file, `ok` or `FAIL` with the reason, then a
# summary; exit status 1 if any file failed, 2 if it could not run.

# URWEB names the compiler, run with the flags in URWEB_FLAGS if that is
# set; otherwise it is the in-tree build, bin/urweb, run with -boot
# -noEmacs (or URWEB_FLAGS).  FMT names the formatter (default:
# urt/urt-format).  The compiler must accept every file: an input that it
# rejects is a failure too.
