/* report.h -- how urt talks: verdict lines, warnings, errors, and the
 * styled fragments inside them.
 *
 * Colour when stdout is a terminal with 256 colours, NO_COLOR is unset
 * and TERM is not dumb; plain text otherwise, with nothing in between.
 * The look is sober and the same everywhere: a verdict, and the WARN or
 * ERROR in front of a message, is a bold word in a muted tone; a test or
 * a file named inside running text is bold, so that it is not drowned
 * out, while one that a line is about -- a verdict's test, a listing's
 * entry -- is in the text's plain weight; an explanation is grey, with a
 * command to type standing out in the text's own colour; nothing has a
 * background.
