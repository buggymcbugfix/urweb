Client-side code
================

The snapshot is `client.js`, the program's own client-side script, the one
served at `app.<sha1>.js`: its URL rules, its compiled functions, its time
format and whatever `jsFile` directives pull in.  The runtime,
`lib/js/urweb.js`, is served as a file of its own and is not the compiler's
work, so it does not appear here.

Each function is labelled with the span it came from and numbered within
the script, from one, in the order the compiler emits them:

    // counter.ur:4:6-4:77
    urfuncs[1] = {c:"t",f:'{c:"l",b:...}'};

Both matter for reading a diff.  The numbers used to be the compiler's
global name indices, so anything added to the standard library shifted
every one of them and the whole snapshot moved; the names in the C are worse
still, since name_js invents them from the same counter.  A span survives
both, and says where to look.

The `recursion` case has a function that calls itself, so the numbering is
exercised where it is easiest to get wrong: a function needs its number
before its body is compiled.  `serverOnly` has no client-side code at all,
and its empty snapshot says so; the day it stops being empty, something
started needing a script that did not before.
