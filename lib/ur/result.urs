(* Operations on Top.result.  The type and its constructors are in Top, so that
they need no qualification.

Be aware that this does not precisely obey the monad laws: `Failure` carries a
message, and the laws only hold if you treat all failures as interchangeable.
Do not rely on a particular message coming out. *)

(* The value, or an error carrying the failure's own message. *)

val readResult : t ::: Type -> read t -> string -> result t

(* Success () when the condition holds, Failure with the message otherwise, so
that a chain of binds can give up partway. *)
